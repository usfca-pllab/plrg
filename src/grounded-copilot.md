# 11/03/23: Grounded Copilot

Leo Framba is going to present [Grounded Copilot: How Programmers Interact with
Code-Generating Models](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3586030).  This paper
presents an empirical study of how programmers are using LLM-based generative
programming assistants (specifically GitHub Copilot).  Their main finding is that the way
programmers interact with Copilot-like assistants is bimodal: "in _acceleration
mode_, the programmer knows what to do next and uses Copilot to get there
faster; in _exploration mode_, the programmer is unsure how to proceed and uses
Copilot to explore their options."

There are also some interesting notes about how Haskell programmers
vs. Python/Rust programmers use Copilot.
